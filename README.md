# Producer-Consumer-Problem
This project solves the Producer-Consumer Problem, a synchronization issue where two processes share a fixed-size buffer. The producer generates data and adds it, while the consumer removes and processes it. Using semaphores, the project ensures proper synchronization,preventing race conditions,deadlocks,and data loss in multi-threaded environments
